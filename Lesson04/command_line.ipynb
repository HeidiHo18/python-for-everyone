    "# Command Line Input \n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that run from the command line can be given input right when they start. Command line input is used to change the way the program works or to give the program some work to do. Consider some of the UNIX commands you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "ls ~/environment\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example the string `~/environment` is a command line argument. In the above the command line tells `ls` what to list. Command line arguments that start with a dash `-` usually change the way the program works. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -la ~/environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two arguments `-la` and `~environment`. It's sometimes more convenient than taking input interactively and can be more secure. In order to see program arguments you have to import the `sys` (for system) module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at arguments in a Jupyter notebook isn't as effective as doing it inside your own program so copy this code into a program of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "program, arg1, arg2 = sys.argv\n",
    "print (\"The program is:\", program)\n",
    "print (\"The first argument is: \", arg1)\n",
    "print (\"The second argument is: \", arg2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program now requires two arguments. Here's and example of how to call the program: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3.6 ./args.py Hello World\n",
    "The program is: ./args.py\n",
    "The first argument is: Hello\n",
    "The second argument is: World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wrong number of arguments is given the program encounters an error: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3.6 ./args.py Hello\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"./args.py\", line 3, in <module>\n",
    "    program, arg1, arg2 = sys.argv \n",
    "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `sys.argv` is a Python list. The syntax in the book unpacks the list in a way that's easy to see. The following two code snippets are identical:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "program, arg1, arg2 = sys.argv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "program = sys.argv[0]\n",
    "arg1 = sys.argv[1]\n",
    "arg2 = sys.argv[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `sys.argv` directly in your code without creating a variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print (f'Hello, I am {sys.argv[0]} and my arguments are \"{sys.argv[1]}\" and \"{sys.argv[2]}\"')\n",
