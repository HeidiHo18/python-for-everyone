    "# Understanding Web Requests \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Programming for the web isn't like programming on a single machine. \n",
    "    * There are at least two computers involved (many more in advanced setups) \n",
    "    * Program flow is based on request/response cycles \n",
    "  * In web programming the two parties involved are \n",
    "    * *The client*. This is the web browser (e.g. Chrome or Firefox). \n",
    "      * The client initiates all requests. \n",
    "    * *The server* The server is your program. \n",
    "      * The server waits for client requests \n",
    "      * The server *validates* and responds to requests \n",
    "  * Requests have to be directed somewhere. \n",
    "  * The *location* that a request is directed to is a URL \n",
    "  * URL is Universal Resource Locator.\n",
    "  * URLs have four parts\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example URL: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://www.lifealgorithmic.com/cis-15?arg=value&arg2=value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "| URL Part | Meaning | \n",
    "| --- ---- | ------- | \n",
    "| `http:` | Specifies the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* should be used to connect to the server. <br> There are many protocols but HTTP is the most common |\n",
    "| `//www.lifealgorithmic.com` | The *host* or the DNS name of the server to be contacted | \n",
    "| `/cis-15` | The *path* of the resource. This is like a file path but the server is free to interpret this any way it wants to. <br> **This part is case sensitive** | \n",
    "| `?arg=value&arg2=value2` | Arguments to the path. These are a convention used by GET forms. The server is free to do anything it wants with these | \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Web browsers primarily issue two kinds of requests. \n",
    "    * `GET` requests load a URL with arguments like the ones in the URL above\n",
    "      * GET requests reveal their arguments in the browser location bar\n",
    "      * That makes them a poor choice for forms with sensitive (or a lot) of data \n",
    "    * `POST` requests load a URL with embedded arguments. \n",
    "      * Embedded arguments are a bit easier to retrieve in a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what the web browser sends the server in a `GET` request: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1\n",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)\n",
    "Host: www.tutorialspoint.com\n",
    "Accept-Language: en-us\n",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n",
    "Connection: Keep-Alive\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what the web browser sends the server in a `POST` request: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1\n",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)\n",
    "Host: www.tutorialspoint.com\n",
    "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n",
    "Content-Length: length\n",
    "Accept-Language: en-us\n",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n",
    "Connection: Keep-Alive\n",
    "\n",
    "licenseID=string&content=string&/paramsXML=string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For more information about GET and POST requests read this:\n",
    "    * https://www.w3schools.com/TagS/ref_httpmethods.asp\n",
    "  * Flask makes it easy to select where a request goes.\n",
    "  * This selection in web speak is known as //routing// \n",
    "    * Which is not the same as the routing you learn about in cis-81\n",
