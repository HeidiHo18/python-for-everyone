    "To the computer all data is a bunch of binary numbers, including strings, pictures and videos. So how do you get from a bunch of numbers to a string? There is an agreed upon way to convert the numbers into letters. The agreed upon way is called a *character encoding*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oldest character encoding that's still in use is called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII uses seven bits to represent 128 different characters. Why so many? To the computer upper case letters are different from lower case letters and there are a whole bunch of special characters. Special characters control how a string looks or is printed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many of the special characters are leftovers from the days when there were no computer monitors. In those days the UNIX command line was typed out using a specially modifed typewriter called a [Teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter#/media/File:ASR-33_at_CHM.agr.jpg). \n",

    "## UTF Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a problem with ASCII. What about if you want to interchange information with non-Americans? ASCII only contains the English alphabet, so you can't write things in other languages. In 1960 when ASCII was developed few other coutries had computers. Now, people all over the world have computers in their pocket. To address this problem the UTF family of encodings was created. UTF is short for Unicode Transformation Format. UTF encodings contain enough characters for every human language *and emojis!*\n",

    "In ASCII every character is one byte (8-bits, with only 7 used). UTF characters can be between one and four bytes (8 to 32 bits). The `ord()` and `chr()` functions are only work on single-byte characters so the new functions `encode()` and `decode()` are used to do the same job. \n",
