    "# The UNIX `head` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX command `head` prints the first few lines of a file. It's useful when you want to preview a text file that could be really long. In this coding challenge you will make a Python program that works like `head`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name your program `head.py` \n",
    "2. Your program should have the standard docstring\n",
    "3. `head.py` should take exactly one argument (the name of a file).\n",
    "4. The program should print the first four lines of the file and exit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Execution \n",
    "\n",
    "The example assumes you have a file called `myfile.txt` an it contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 1\n",
    "Line 2 \n",
    "Line 3 \n",
    "Line 4 \n",
    "Line 5\n",
    "Line 6\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of your program should look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "$ python3.6 head.py myfile.txt \n",
    "Line 1 \n",
    "Line 2\n",
    "Line 3\n",
    "Line 4\n",
