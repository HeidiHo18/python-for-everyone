    "# Project: Designing with Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you'll redesign your [Improved Mad Libs](../Lesson05/project_madlib_files.ipynb) project to use functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Refactoring Mad Libs\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming *refactoring* is when you change code to improve it's functionality or readability. In this project you will refactor MadLibs to use functions. Before you start make sure that your Mad Libs code works reliably. The best way to refactor is to make small changes, then retest your code to make sure the changes didn't break anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin your project in a file called `madlibs_functions.py` and start with the code below: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(): \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__' :\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by taking all of the code from your Mad Lib generator and moving it into the `main()` function. Retest your Mad Lib generator to make sure it still works after you move code into `main()`. Once you're satisfied that your program still works add the following functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name: `read_madlib_file`\n",
    "    * Read the MadLib template file and return the first four lines (the MadLib template and three word types).\n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `filename`: The name of a MadLib template file. \n",
    "    * Returns: `mad_lib`, `word_type_1`, `word_type_2`, `word_type_3`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name `do_ask_word`\n",
    "    * This function prompts the user for **one** word and takes one argument called `word_type`. The function prompts the user for a word and must print the contents of `word_type` in the prompt. \n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `word_type`: The type of word to prompt for. \n",
    "    * Returns: The word typed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name `display_madlib` \n",
    "    * This function displays the Mad Lib and saves the output to a file. It takes two arguments, `mad_lib_complete` and `output_file`. `mad_lib_complete` contains the completed MadLib to print and `output_file` is the whole name of the file to write the completed MadLib to.  \n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `mad_lib_complete`: The completed Mad Lib \n",
    "        * `output_file`: The name of the file to save \n",
    "    * Returns: None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write your functions one at a time and retest your code after each one.** Be sure to close all files. Each function must have a docstring that describes the function, its arguments and return values where applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Your Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `projtest` program tests your project the same way that I do when I grade. From now on the `projtest` program will require that there is no code outside of a function in your project. You will see errors if there is. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "$ projtest madlibs_functions.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **There should be no code outside of a function** except the following:\n",
    "    * Any `import` statements \n",
    "    * The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` lines at the bottom of the starter code.\n",
    "  * Your code should have the functions listed, and they must be named exactly as requested \n",
    "    * Each function must have a docstring that describes it \n",
    "    * Each function must have the described arguments and return values \n",
    "  * Your code must be in a file name `madlibs_functions.py` "
