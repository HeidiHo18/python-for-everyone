    "When you use your own classes in a program it's called *Object Oriented Programming*. In Python you have a choice to use OOP and most small programs won't need classes of their own. In other languages, like Java, all programs must be witten using OOP. There are great advantages to OOP. \n",

Other programmers assume they can call your functions but will avoid using your variables directly. Cooperation makes larger programs --written by hundreds or thousands of programmers-- possible. There are many tricks and features of classes in Python. The most important ones we'll learn today.\n",
