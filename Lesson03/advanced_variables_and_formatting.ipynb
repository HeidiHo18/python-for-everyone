    "| `Lesson03/web_calc/web_calc.py`| The Python program that uses Flask to generate web pages. | \n",

    "$ cd Lesson03/web_calc\n",
    "$ python3.6 web_calc.py \n",
    "```\n",

    " * Environment: production\n",
    "   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.\n",
    "   Use a production WSGI server instead.\n",

    "The program doesn't return to the prompt because it's waiting to serve web requests. You can access the program by pressing the \"Preview\" link near the \"Run\" link in Cloud9. The \"Preview\" button opens a tab in Cloud9 IDE that works like a web browser. If you would like to use your desktop browser copy the URL from the preview into your browser. \n",

    "Place your project code here and put your HTML into the `table` variable. **In Python indentation matters.** Your code should line up with the indentation level of the `table` vairable. \n",

    "## Viewing Your Work \n",
    "\n",
    "When you save `web_calc.py` the Flask server reloads your program. If you have a syntax error Flask will quit and you won't be able to reload the page. Check the command line to ensure flask is running and restart it if necessary. \n"
